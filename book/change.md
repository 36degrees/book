Given the centrality of the internet today, it is about time for a
book like this one. But the web is a dynamic, ever-changing place. The
first web browser came into being in 1989 and it did not support
colors, images, styling, or scripting. The web today is the result of
three decades of evolution driven by market forces, implementation
quirks, and the ever-expanding reach of the web. I both hope that this
book will remain valuable for years to come, and also hope for
dramatic change that makes it obsolete.

This book ignores modern developments like HTTP 2 and Web Assembly.
Perhaps a later edition of this book will have to cover them. Nor does
this book talk much about hardware virtualization like Web Bluetooth
or format centralization like web video. Maybe in the future those
will be central to what a browser does.

So in a few years this book could be obsolete, or at least out-dated.
But the value of this book goes beyond a point-in-time description of
how things work. Many dedicated, brilliant, and talented engineers
have devoted themselves to the web over its first three decades. The
structure of the web embeds their ideas, inventions, and taste. I hope
this book passes them along.
