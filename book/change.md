I hope the centrality of the internet makes this book timely. But the
web is a dynamic, ever-changing place. The first web browser came into
being in 1989 and it did not support colors, images, styling, or
scripting. Three decades of evolution driven by market forces,
implementation quirks, and the ever-expanding reach of the web made
browsers what they are today; those forces still matter. Let this book
remain valuable for years to come, let dramatic change makes it
obsolete.

This book skips modern developments like HTTP 2+ and Web Assembly;
perhaps a later edition of this book will have to cover them. Nor does
this book talk much about hardware virtualization like Web Bluetooth
or format centralization like web video. Maybe in the future those
will be more central to what browsers do.

Many dedicated, brilliant, and talented engineers have devoted
themselves to the web over its first three decades. The structure of
the web embeds their ideas, inventions, and taste. Even if, in a few
years, this book is out-dated, I hope it still passes those lessons
along.
