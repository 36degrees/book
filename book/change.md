Given the centrality of the internet today, I thought it was about
time for a book like this one. And I certainly hope that the core
architecture of web browsers will stay the same long enough for this
book to be of value. But the web is a dynamic, ever-changing place.
The first web browser came into being in 1989 and it did not support
colors, images, styling, or scripting. The web today is the result of
three decades of evolution driven by market forces, implementation
quirks, and the ever-expanding reach of the web.

This book skips many modern developments, like HTTP 2 and Web
Assembly. Perhaps a later edition of this book will have to cover
them. Nor does the book talk much about hardware virtualization like
Web Bluetooth or format centralization like web video, even though one
day either could be central to what a browser does. In a few years
this book could be obsolete, or at least out-dated.

That said, many dedicated, brilliant, and talented engineers have
devoted themselves to the web over its first three decades. The
structure of the web is their creation, not an accident, and embeds
lessons useful in any program. The value of this book, then, goes
beyond a point-in-time description of how things work. I hope readers
find taht these lessons, these patterns of structure, stick with them.
