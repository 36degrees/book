  - title: Why Widgets?
    link: https://browser.engineering/blog/why-widgets.html
    description:
      We're working interactive widgets to Web Browser Engineering to
      better explain the concepts and to make room for discoveries.
      But it's not easy!
  - title: History of the Web
    link: https://browser.engineering/history.html
    description:
      Today we’re releasing a new chapter on the History of the Web.
      The rest of the book is about how web browsers work, but this
      chapter is about why. It’s about the goals and motivations for
      the web and for web browsers, which shape the way they work.
  - title: Laying Out Pages
    link: https://browser.engineering/layout.html
    description:
      We’re releasing Chapter 5. It introduces layout trees, the data
      structure at the center of layout. Building, laying out, and
      rendering layout trees is how every web page you view is
      rendered!
  - title: Browsers and the Web
    link: https://browser.engineering/intro.html
    description:
      The intro chapter is here! Now you get to find out why this book
      was worth writing, mostly in Chris’s words. Plus you’ll learn a
      few things about where the web came from and how the sausage is
      made.
  - title: Constructing the Document Tree
    link: https://browser.engineering/html.html
    description:
      Chapter 4 is out! It’s decked out with HTML parsing and error
      handling, and starts building out the core data structures of
      the browser. Plus, it has tips for leveraging implicit tags to
      make your HTML cleaner and simpler!
  - title: Code Outlines (blog post)
    link: https://browser.engineering/blog/outlines.html
    description:
      I've added a code outline tool to help you see the
      intermediate-level structure of a web browser. As Chris and I
      write more chapters, it'll become more and more useful.
  - title: Formatting Text
    link: https://browser.engineering/text.html
    description:
      Chapter 3 is ready. Read about typography, baselines, and tags!
      Our browser lines up text with style! My favorite aside is the
      Michigan Supreme Court case on font sizes.
  - title: Why Python? (blog post)
    link: https://browser.engineering/blog/why-python.html
    description:
      Why is Web Browser Engineering in Python? In short, Python is
      popular, readable, and has access to standard system APIs.
  - title: Introducing Chris Harrelson
    link: https://browser.engineering
    description:
      Have you noticed that the byline on https://browser.engineering
      has changed? Chris Harrelson will be joining Web Browser
      Engineering as a co-author. He's already working to make WBE
      deeper and more realistic based on his experience on the Chrome
      team.
  - title: Drawing to the Screen
    link: https://browser.engineering/graphics.html
    description:
      Chapter 2 is ready. Read about window handles, display lists,
      and events. Our browser creates a window, draws text to it, and
      tells a story about a monkey. (My favorite part is the aside on
      Chinese line layout.)
  - title: Typos and Comments (blog post)
    link: https://browser.engineering/blog/feedback.html
    description:
      I've written some code to crowdsource typo corrections and
      comments from readers. Looking forward to seeing your feedback!
  - title: The Beginning (blog post)
    link: https://browser.engineering/blog/beginning.html
    description:
      A quick backstory behind the book, and my plan for writing it.
  - title: Downloading Web Pages
    link: https://browser.engineering/http.html
    description:
      Chapter 1 is about URLs, sockets, and HTTP requests. Read about
      how a browser creates a network connection, what the OS does to
      help, and how it requests specific web pages.
