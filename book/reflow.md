title: Saving Partial Layouts
chapter: 10
prev: scripts
next: security
...

Our little browser now renders pages that *change*. That means it's
now laying out the page multiple times. That translates to a lot of
wasted work: a page doesn\'t usually change *much*, and layout is
expensive. So in this chapter we\'ll modify our browser to reuse as
much as it can between layouts.

::: {.todo}
- I don't like that `InlineLayout` creates both line and text items;
it makes reflow for that layout type very odd.
- Also, we should standardize `layout2` to accept `x` and `y` arguments.
- Finally, I think we need a bottom-up height pass as well. Otherwise
this is wrong!
- Maybe move clipping to the graphics lab?
- Should retained display lists be an exercise?
:::

Profiling our browser
=====================

Before we start speeding up our browser, let\'s confirm that layout is
taking up a lot of time. And before that, let\'s list out everythin
our browser does. First, on initial load:

-   It downloads a web page (including parsing the URL, opening a
    connection, sending a request, and getting a response);
-   Then it parses the HTML (including lexing and parsing)
-   Then it parses the CSS (including finding linked CSS files,
    downloading them, parsing them, and sorting them)
-   Then it runs the JavaScript (including finding linked JS files,
    downloading them, and running them)

And then every time it does layout:

-   It styles the page
-   It lays out the page
-   It computes the display list
-   It applies all of the drawing commands
-   And it draws the browser chrome

I\'d like to measure how long each of these phases takes. Python does
have various profilers, but the easiest thing to do is to check the
clock every now and then. To keep it all well-contained, I\'m going to
make a `Timer` class to store the time and report how long each phase
took.

``` {.python}
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.phase = None
        self.time = None

    def start(self, name):
        if self.phase: self.stop()
        self.phase = name
        self.time = time.time()

    def stop(self):
        dt = time.time() - self.time
        print("[{:>10.6f}] {}".format(dt, self.phase))
        self.phase = None
```

That wacky string in the `print` statement is a Python \"format
string\" so that the time is right-aligned, ten characters wide, and
has six digits after the decimal point. Using `Timer` is pretty easy.
First we define a `timer` field in our browser:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.timer = Timer()
```

Then we call `start` every time we start one of the phases above. For
example, in `browse`, I start the `Downloading` phase:

``` {.python}
self.timer.start("Downloading")
```

Then, at the end of `render`, I stop the timer:

``` {.python}
self.timer.stop()
```

Your results may not match mine,[^1] but here\'s what I saw on my
console on a full page load for this web page.

    [  0.225331] Download
    [  0.028922] Parse HTML
    [  0.001835] Parse CSS
    [  0.003599] Run JS
    [  0.007073] Style
    [  0.517131] Layout
    [  0.022553] Display List
    [  0.275645] Rendering
    [  0.008225] Chrome

The overall process takes about one second (60 frames), with layout
consuming half and then rendering and network consuming the rest.
Moreover, you only download on initial load, so it\'s really layout
and rendering that need to be faster. By the way, keep in mind that
while networking in a real web browser is similar enough to our toy
version,[^2] layout is *much more* complex in real browsers![^3][^4]

By the way, this might be the point in the book where you realize you
accidentally implemented something super-inefficiently. If something
other than the network, layout, or rendering is taking a long time,
look into that.[^inexact] This chapter can only help speed up layout
and rendering!

[^inexact]: The exact speeds of each of these phases can vary quite a
    bit between implementations, and might depend (for example) on the
    exercises you ended up implementing, so don\'t sweat the details
    too much.

Adding `:hover` styles
======================

To really demand faster layout and rendering, let\'s implement a
browser feature that really taxes them: hover styles. The `:hover` CSS
selector applies to whichever element the mouse is currently over.
It's often used together with other selectors: an `a:hover` selector
to change the color of links that you're hovering over, for example.
In our browser, with our limited selectors language, we can at least
try out the style:

``` {.python}
:hover {
    border-top-width: 1px;
    border-right-width: 1px;
    border-bottom-width: 1px;
    border-left-width: 1px;
}
```

This should draw a box around any element we hover over. Let's
implement it. First, we need to parse the `:hover` selector. Start
with a new selector class:

``` {.python}
class PseudoclassSelector:
    def __init__(self, cls):
        self.cls = cls

    def matches(self, node):
        return self.cls in node.pseudoclasses

    def score(self):
        return 0
```

This expects an `ElementNode.pseudoclasses` field, which I\'ll
initialize to an empty set:

``` {.python}
class ElementNode:
    def __init__(self, parent, tagname):
        # ...
        self.pseudoclasses = set()
```

Next, `PseudoclassSelector`s need to be created in the parser. That's
basically the same as class selectors, replacing the period with a
colon:

``` {.python}
def selector(self, i):
    # ...
    elif self[i] == ":":
        name, i = self.value(i + 1)
        return PseudoclassSelector(name), i
    # ...
```

Finally we need to handle hover events. In Tk, you do that by binding
the `<Motion>` event:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.window.bind("<Motion>", self.handle_hover)
```

The `handle_hover` method is pretty simple; it calls `find_element`,
walks up the tree until it finds an `ElementNode`, and then sets its
`hover` pseudoclass. It also has to unset the `hover` pseudoclass on
the previously-hovered element, so I store a reference to that element
in the `hovered_elt` field, initialized to `None` in the constructor.

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def handle_hover(self, e):
        x, y = e.x, e.y - 60 + self.scrolly
        elt = find_element(x, y, self.nodes)
        while elt and not isinstance(elt, ElementNode):
            elt = elt.parent
        if self.hovered_elt:
            self.hovered_elt.pseudoclasses.remove("hover")
        if elt:
            elt.pseudoclasses.add("hover")
            self.hovered_elt = elt
        self.relayout()
```

Note that hover calls `relayout`, because by changing the pseudoclasses
it potentially changes which rules apply to which elements and thus
which borders are applied where.

Try this out! Black rectangles should appear around every element you
hover overâ€”except it\'ll take about a second to do! We really need to
speed up layout.

::: {.quirk}
Actually, this is not how `:hover` works, because in normal CSS if you
hover over an element you probably also hover over its parent, and both
get the `:hover` style. With our selector language, I'm at a loss for
a true hover style that incrementalizes well, so I'm implementing a
fake `:hover` selector instead. Put simply, this chapter is a guide to
incremental reflow, not hover selectors.
:::

Relative positions
==================

How can we make layout faster? In the intro to this chapter, I
mentioned that the layout doesn\'t change *much*, and that\'s going to
be the key here. But what exactly do I mean? When the page is
*reflowed*,[^5] like on hover, the sizes and positions of *most*
elements on the page change. Borders-on-hover changes the height
of the hovered element, for example, and that moves other
elements down the page.

But even if some parts of the page move, they don't change size, and
their relative positions won\'t change. We will leverage this fact to
skip as much work as possible on reflow by splitting layout into two
phases. First, we\'ll compute *relative* positions for each element;
then, we\'ll compute the absolute positions by adding the parent
offset to the relative position. The `layout` function will become
two: `layout1` and `layout2`.[^6]

I\'ll start with block layout to understand this split better. In
block layout, the *x* position is computed from the parent\'s left
content edge and then changed in `layout` to account for the margin.
Likewise, the *y* position is initialized from the argument to
`layout` and then changed once to account for margins. In other words,
neither changes much, so it\'s safe to move these absolute position
fields to `layout2`.:

``` {.python}
def layout1(self):
    y = 0
    # ...

def layout2(self, y):
    self.x = parent.content_left()
    self.y = y
    self.x += self.ml
    self.y += self.mt
```

Note that `layout1` doesn\'t take any arguments any more, since it
doesn\'t need to know its position to figure out the *relative*
positions of its contents. Meanwhile, `layout2` still needs a `y`
parameter from its parent.

The old `layout` method created children and recursively called
`child.layout` to lay out its children. We need to split that
recursive call into two: `layout1` should recursively call
`child.layout1`, while `layout2` should recursively call
`child.layout2`:

``` {.python}
y = self.y
for child in self.children:
    child.layout2(y)
    y += child.h + (child.mt + child.mb if isinstance(child, BlockLayout) else 0)
```

One final subtlety: I plan to keep layout objects around between
reflows, and that means we won\'t call the constructor on reflow. So
layout object can't read from the page in the constructor: the
constructor won\'t be re-run when the page changes. In block layout,
the margin, padding, and border values are computed in the
constructor; let\'s move that computation into `layout1`. Plus, the
`children` array is initialized in the constructor, but it\'s only
modified in `layout1`. Let\'s move that `children` array to `layout1`.

Let's review the changes before executing them in the other layout
modes:

`layout1`

:   This method is responsible for computing the twelve margin, padding,
    and border fields, *and* for creating the child layouts, *and* for
    assigning the `w` and `h` fields on the `BlockLayout`. Plus, it must
    call `layout1` on its children. It may not read the `x` or `y`
    fields on anything.

`layout2`

:   This method may read the `w` and `h` fields and is responsible for
    assigning the `x` and `y` fields on the `BlockLayout`. Plus, it must
    call `layout2` on its children.

With `BlockLayout` sorted, let\'s move on to text, input, and line
layout. I\'ll save inline layout to the very end.

In `TextLayout`, the `layout` function does basically nothing, because
everything happens in the constructor. We\'ll rename `layout` to
`layout2` and move the computation of the `font`, `color`, `w`, and `h`
fields from the constructor into `layout1`.

In `InputLayout`, the width and height are computed in the constructor
(so let\'s move them to `layout1`), while `layout` computes `x` and `y`
but also creates a child `InlineLayout` for textareas. Let\'s put the
child layout creation in `layout1` and leave the `x` and `y` computation
in `layout2`. Plus, `layout2` will need to call `layout2` on the child
layout, if there is one.

In `LineLayout` there's a small quirk: it does not create its own
children (`InlineLayout` is in charge of that) and it does not compute
its own width (its children do that in their `attach` methods). So
unlike the other layout modes, `LineLayout` will initialize the
`children` and `w` fields in its constructor, and its `layout1` won\'t
recursively call `layout1` on its children or compute the `w` field:

``` {.python}
class LineLayout:
    def __init__(self, parent):
        self.parent = parent
        parent.children.append(self)
        self.w = 0
        self.children = []

    def layout1(self):
        self.h = 0
        leading = 2
        for child in self.children:
            self.h = max(self.h, child.h + leading)
```

The `layout2` method looks more normal, however:

``` {.python}
class LineLayout:
    def layout2(self, y):
        self.y = y
        self.x = self.parent.x

        x = self.x
        leading = 2
        y += leading / 2
        for child in self.children:
            child.layout2(x, y)
            x += child.w + child.space
```

Finally, inline layout. Currently, `InlineLayout.layout` computes the
`x`, `y`, and `w` fields, then creates children with the `recurse`
method, and then calls `layout` on each child. While layout phase
should recurse go in? Peeking inside `recurse` and its helper methods
`text` and `input`, I see that it only reads the `w` field, so all of
`recurse` can happen in `layout1`.

``` {.python}
class InlineLayout:
    def layout1(self):
        self.children = []
        self.children.append(LineLayout(self))
        self.w = self.parent.content_width()
        self.recurse(self.node)
        h = 0
        for child in self.children:
            child.layout1()
            h += child.h
        self.h = h
```

Since `InlineLayout` is responsible not only for its children (line
layouts) but their children (text and input layouts) as well, we need
update the `text` and `input` helpers to call `layout1` on the new
layout objects they create.

Meanwhile, `layout2` will compute `x` and `y` and also recursively
call `child.layout2`:

``` {.python}
class InlineLayout:
    def layout2(self, y):
        self.x = self.parent.content_left()
        self.y = self.parent.content_top()
        y = self.y
        for child in self.children:
            child.layout2(y)
            y += child.h
```

Note that I\'m accepting a `y` argument in `layout2`, even though I
don\'t use it. That\'s because `BlockLayout` passes one. Probably it
would be good to accept both `x` and `y` in every `layout2` method,
though that\'s not how I\'ve written my code. Also don\'t forget to
update `InputLayout` to pass a `y` argument in `layout2` when it handles
its child layout.

I want to emphasize that `recurse` is by far the slowest part of our
browser\'s layout algorithm,[^7] and since it happens in `layout1` we
will be able to mostly skip it. This will be our the big performance
win.

Finally, we need to update our browser to actually call all of these
functions. In `Browser.relayout`, where we used to call `layout`, let\'s
call `layout1` followed by `layout2`:

``` {.python}
self.layout = BlockLayout(self.page, self.nodes)
self.layout.layout1()
self.layout.layout2(0)
```

::: {.warning}
I cannot overemphasize how it important it is to *stop and debug now*.
Fix the minor bugs (for me: forgetting to add `self` to variables when
moving them out of constructors; forgetting to move the `children`
array; and passing the wrong number of arguments to `layout2` before
we make things more complicated by only calling `layout1` sometimes.
It's also a good idea to read through all of the constructors for the
layout classes to make sure they\'re not doing anything interesting.
:::

Incrementalizing layout
=======================

If you time the browser, now that we\'ve split layout into two phases,
you\'ll find that not much has changed; for me, layout got about five
percent slower. To find out more, I made `layout1` and `layout2`
separate phases in the timer. Here\'s what it looks like:

    [  0.498251] Layout1
    [  0.006418] Layout2

So really `layout1` is taking all of the time and `layout2` is
near-instantaneous.[^8] That validates our next step: avoiding `layout1`
whenever we can.

The idea is simple, but the implementation will be tricky, because
sometimes you *do* need to lay an element out again; for example, the
element you hover over gains a border, and that changes its width and
therefore potentially its line breaking behavior. So you may need to
run `layout1` on *that* element. But you won\'t need to do so on its
siblings. The responsibilities of `layout1` and `layout2`, outlined
above, will be our guide to what must run when. Because `layout1` only
reads the node style, it only needs to be called when the node or its
style changes.

Let\'s plan. Look over your browser and list all of the places where
`relayout` is called. For me, these are:

-   In `parse`, on initial page load.
-   In `js_innerHTML`, when new elements are added to the page (and old
    ones removed).
-   In `edit_input`, when the contents of an input element is changed.
-   In `handle_hover`, when an element is hovered over.

Each of these needs a different approach:

-   In `parse`, we are doing the initial page load so we don\'t even
    have an existing layout. We need to create one, and that involves
    calling `layout1` on everything.
-   In `js_innerHTML`, the new elements and their parent are the only
    elements that have had their nodes or style changed.
-   In `edit_input`, only the input element itself has had a change to
    node or style.
-   In `handle_hover`, only the newly-hovered and newly-not-hovered
    elements have had a change to node or style.

Let\'s split `relayout` into pieces to reflect the above. First,
let\'s move the construction of `self.page` and `self.layout` into
`parse`, since they only occur on initial load. Then let\'s create a
new `reflow` function that calls `style` and `layout1` on an element
of your choice. And finally, `relayout` will just contain the call to
`layout2` and the computation of the display list. Here\'s `parse` and
`relayout`:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def parse(self, body):
        # ...
        self.page = Page()
        self.layout = BlockLayout(self.page, self.nodes)
        self.reflow(self.nodes)
        self.relayout()

    def relayout(self):
        self.start("Layout2")
        self.layout.layout2(0)
        self.max_h = self.layout.h
        self.timer.start("Display List")
        self.display_list = self.layout.display_list()
        self.render()
```

The new `reflow` method is a little more complex. Here\'s what it looks
like after a simple reorganization:

``` {.python}
class Browser:
    def reflow(self, elt):
        self.timer.start("Style")
        style(self.nodes, self.rules)
        self.timer.start("Layout1")
        self.layout.layout1()
```

Note that while `reflow` takes an element as an argument, it ignores it,
and restyles and re-lays-out the whole page. That\'s clearly silly, so
let\'s fix that. First, the `style` call only needs to be passed
`elt`:

``` {.python}
style(elt, self.rules)
```

Second, instead of calling `layout1` on `self.layout`, we only want to
call it on the layout object corresponding to `elt`. The easiest way to
find that is with a big loop:[^10]

``` {.python}
def find_layout(layout, elt):
    if not isinstance(layout, LineLayout) and layout.node == elt:
        return layout
    for child in layout.children:
        out = find_layout(child, elt)
        if out: return out
```

This is definitely inefficient, because we could store the
element-layout correspondence on the node itself, but let\'s run with it
for the sake of simplicity. We can now change the
`self.layout.layout1()` line to:

``` {.python}
layout = find_layout(self.layout, elt)
if layout: layout.layout1()
```

This mostly works, but `find_layout` won\'t be happy on initial page
load because at that point some of the layout objects don\'t have
children yet. Let\'s add a line for that:[^11]

``` {.python}
def find_layout(layout, elt):
    if not hasattr(layout, "children"):
        return layout
    # ...
```

::: {.todo}
Relying on `hasattr` is extremely ugly. Perhaps we need dirty bits?
:::

The logic of returning any layout object without a `children` field is
that if some layout object does not have such a field, it definitely
hasn\'t had `layout1` called on it and therefore we should, which we do
by returning it from `find_layout`.

Finally, let\'s go back to place where we call `relayout` and add a call
to `reflow`. The only complicated case is `handle_hover`, where you need
to call `reflow` both on the old `hovered_elt` and on the new one. (You
only need to call `layout` once, though.)

With this tweak, you should see `layout1` taking up almost no time,
except on initial page load, and hovering should be much more
responsive. For me the timings now look like this:

``` {.python}
[  0.009246] Layout1
[  0.003590] Layout2
```

::: {.todo}
I should add rendering times.
:::

So now rendering takes up roughly 89% of the runtime when hovering, and
everything else takes up 32 milliseconds total. That\'s not one frame,
but it\'s not bad for a Python application!

Faster rendering
================

Let\'s put a bow on this lab by speeding up `render`. It\'s actually
super easy: we just need to avoid drawing stuff outside the browser
window; in the graphics world this is called *clipping*. Now,
sometimes stuff is half-inside and half-outside the browser window. We
still want to draw it! For that, we'll need to know where that stuff
starts and ends. I\'m going to update the `DrawText` constructor to
compute that:

``` {.python}
self.y1 = y
self.y2 = y + 50
```

::: {.todo}
This misdirection is stupid. It should implement it the right way,
notice the slowdown, and improve it.
:::

Ok, wait, that\'s not the code you expected. Why 50? Why not use
`font.measure` and `font.metrics`? Because `font.measure` and
`font.metrics` are quite slow: they actually execute text layout, and
that takes a long time! So I\'ll be using only *y* position for
clipping, and I\'ll be using an overapproximation to `font.metrics`. The
50 is not a magic value; it just needs to be *bigger* than any actual
line height. If it\'s too big, we render a few too many `DrawText`
objects, but it won\'t change the resulting page.

Now both `DrawText` and `DrawRect` objects have top-left and
bottom-right coordinates and we can check those in `render`:

``` {.python}
for cmd in self.display_list:
    if cmd.y2 - self.scrolly < 0: continue
    if cmd.y2 - self.scrolly > 600: continue
    cmd.draw(self.scrolly - 60, self.canvas)
```

That takes rendering down from a quarter-second to a hundredth of a
second for me, and makes the hover animation fairly smooth. A hover
reflow now takes roughly 25 milliseconds, with the display list
computation 44% of that, rendering 39%, and `layout2` 13%. We could
continue optimizing (for example, tracking invalidation rectangles in
rendering), but I\'m going to call this a success. We\'ve made
interacting with our browser more than 30 times faster, and in the
process made the `:hover` selector perfectly usable.

Summary
=======

The more complex, two-phase layout algorithm in this chapter sped up
my toy browser by roughly 30Ã—, to the point that it can now run simple
animations like hovering.

Exercises
=========

-   When `TextLayout.display_list` creates a `DrawText`, it already
    knows the width and height of the text to be laid out. Use that to
    compute `y2` and `x2` in `DrawText`. Add horizontal clipping to
    the rendering function.
-   Turns out, the `font.measure` function is quite slow! Change Add a
    cache for the size of each word in a given font. Measure the
    speed-up that results.
-   Extend the timer to measure the time to lay out each type of
    layout object. That is---compute how much time is spent laying out
    `BlockLayout` objects, how much in `InlineLayout`, and so on. What
    percentage of the `layout1` time is spent handling inline layouts?
    If you did the first and second exercises, measure the effect.
-   Add support for the `setAttribute` method in JavaScript. Note that
    this method can be used to change the `id`, `class`, or `style`
    attribute, which can change which styles apply to the affected
    element; make sure to handle that with reflow. Furthermore, you can
    use `setAttribute` to update the `href` attribute of a `<link>`
    element, which means you must download a new CSS file and recompute
    the set of CSS rules. Make sure to handle that edge case as well. If
    you change the `src` attribute of a `<script>` tag, oddly enough,
    the new JavaScript file is not downloaded or executed.
-   Add support for `setTimeout` command in JavaScript;
    `setTimeout(ms, f)` should run the function `f` in `ms`
    milliseconds. In Python, you can use the `Timer` class from the
    `threading` library, but be careful---the callback on the timer is
    called in a separate thread, so you need to make sure no other
    JavaScript is running when calling the timeout handler. Use
    `setTimeout` to implement a simple animation; for example, you might
    implement a \"typewriter effect\" where a paragraph is typed out
    letter-by-letter. Check that your browser handles the animation
    relatively smoothly.

    2.4GHz i5, 8 GB of LPDDR3 memory, and an Intel Iris Plus graphics
    655 with 1.5 GB of video memory, running macOS 10.14.6.

[^2]: Granted with caching, keep-alive, parallel connections, and
    incremental parsing to hide the delay...

[^3]: Of course they\'re also not written in Python...

[^4]: Now is a good time to mention that benchmarking a real browser is
    a lot harder than benchmarking ours. A real browser will run most of
    these phases simultaneously, and may also split the work over
    multiple CPU and GPU processes. Counting how much time everything
    takes is a chore. Real browsers are also memory hogs, so optimizing
    memory usage is just as important for them, which is a real pain to
    measure in Python. Luckily our browser doesn\'t have tabs so it\'s
    unlikely to strain for memory!

[^5]: That is, laid out but excluding initial layout.

[^6]: Look, I\'ve got a bit of a cold, I\'m not feeling very creative.

[^7]: Because it calls `font.measure`, which has to do a slow and
    expensive text rendering to get the right size. Text is crazy.

[^8]: "Near-instantaneousâ€½ 6.418 milliseconds is almost 40% of our
    one-frame time budget!" This is a toy web browser written in
    Python. Cut me some slack.

[^10]: There is a subtlety in the code below. It\'s important to check
    the current node before recursing, because some nodes have two
    layout objects, in particular block layout elements that contain
    text and thus have both a `BlockLayout` and an `InlineLayout`. We
    want the parent, and doing the check before recursing guarantees us
    that.

[^11]: I recognize that in many languages, unlike in Python, you can\'t
    just add fields in some method without declaring them earlier on. I
    assume that in all of those cases you\'ve been initializing the
    fields with dummy values, and then you\'d check for that dummy value
    instead of using `hasattr`. Just make sure your dummy value for
    `children` isn\'t the empty list, since that is also a valid value.
    Better to use a null pointer or something like that, whatever your
    language provides.
