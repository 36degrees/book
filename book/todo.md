Text
====

I am editing the chapters following the first iteration of the course.

- [x] All chapters have received an initial read-through
- [x] Debugging tips have moved out of the [Preliminaries](preliminaries.md)
- [ ] The [Preliminaries](preliminaries.md) need to discuss installing
  Python
- [ ] [Chapter 2](graphics.md) feels too short; maybe clipping should
  move here
- [ ] [Chapter 4](html.md) needs to motivate attributes
- [ ] [Chapter 7](chrome.md) should add forward buttons
- [ ] [Chapter 7](chrome.md) should implement multiple text sizes
- [ ] [Chapter 10](reflow.md) needs a rewrite to handle a major bug
- [ ] [Chapter 11](security.md) must remove the straw-man insecure
  implementations
- [ ] [Chapters 8](forms.md) needs minor edits

Code
====

I plan to have "gold-standard" code for each chapter.

- [x] Code for chapters 1 and 2 edited
- [ ] Code for chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 not yet edited
- [ ] [Chapter 8](forms.md) needs to abstract over finding elements
- [ ] [Chapter 9](scripts.md) needs to split the JS environment from
  the browser
- [ ] [Chapter 10](reflow.md) needs to be more uniform and clearer
- [ ] I plan a cleaned-up, "final" browser as an appendix

Website
=======

The website is up, but in a minimal form.

- [x] Domain name purchased and set up, and TLS enabled
- [x] The site scores well on page speed tests
- [x] Feedback system for typos and comments deployed
- [x] Server logs set up, but not deeper analytics
- [ ] No work on accessibility

I have barely begun branding and styling the website.

- [x] Brand and font choices drafted
- [ ] Styling is still very minimal
- [ ] Web page does not have a coherent visual identity
- [ ] Mobile experience rudimentary

Content
=======

I plan tests, exercises, screenshots, and "Go further" links.

- [x] Each chapter has five exercises
- [ ] There are currently no tests
- [ ] Exercises should be distributed among sections
- [ ] Screenshots not begun
- [ ] Chapter 1 has "Go further" links, the others don't
