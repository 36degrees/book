This book is a work in progress. I track my progress on the text, the
website, and the additional content.

Text
====

I am editing the chapters following the first iteration of the course.

- [x] Chapters i, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 edited
- [ ] Chapters ii, 4, 7 edited but with more to do
- [ ] Chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, A, B drafted but not yet edited

Website
=======

The website is up, but in a minimal form.

- [x] Domain name purchased and set up, and TLS enabled.
- [x] The site scores well on page speed tests.
- [ ] No work on accessibility
- [ ] No feedback system for typos and comments.

I have barely begun branding and styling the website.

- [x] Brand and font choices drafted
- [ ] Styling is still very minimal
- [ ] Web page does not have a coherent visual identity
- [ ] Mobile experience rudimentary

Content
=======

I plan code listings, tests, screenshots, and "Go further" links.

- [ ] Chapter 1 and 2 code is edited, while the rest are drafted
- [ ] Chapter 1 has "Go further" links, the others don't
- [ ] There are currently no tests
- [ ] Screenshots not begun
