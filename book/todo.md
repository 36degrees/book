Text
====

I am editing the chapters following the first iteration of the course.

- [x] Chapters i, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, A, B edited
- [ ] Chapter 11 needs a read-through
- [ ] Chapters ii, 4, 9, and 10 need major edits
- [ ] Chapters 7, 8 need minor edits

After editing the text, I will edit the code:

- [x] Code for chapters 1 and 2 edited
- [ ] Code for chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 not yet edited
- [ ] Code for chapters 9 and 10 needs major edits

Website
=======

The website is up, but in a minimal form.

- [x] Domain name purchased and set up, and TLS enabled
- [x] The site scores well on page speed tests
- [x] Feedback system for typos and comments deployed
- [ ] Set up server logs
- [ ] No work on accessibility

I have barely begun branding and styling the website.

- [x] Brand and font choices drafted
- [ ] Styling is still very minimal
- [ ] Web page does not have a coherent visual identity
- [ ] Mobile experience rudimentary

Content
=======

I plan tests, screenshots, and "Go further" links. I'd also like to
have a cleaned-up "final" browser to read.

- [ ] There are currently no tests
- [ ] Exercises should be distributed among sections
- [ ] Screenshots not begun
- [ ] Chapter 1 has "Go further" links, the others don't
- [ ] Final browser not edited
