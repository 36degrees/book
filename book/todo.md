This book is a work in progress. I track my progress on the text, the
website, and the additional content.

Text
====

I am working on editing the chapters following the first iteration of
the course.

- Chapters i, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, y edited
- Chapters ii, 4, 7 edited but with more to do
- Chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, A, B drafted but not yet edited

Website
=======

The website is up, but in a minimal form.

- Domain name purchased and set up, and TLS enabled.
- Latency not yet optimized.

I plan to set up a sort of heavily-moderated comment system for
correcting typos and collecting feedback. I haven't set that up yet.

I have barely begun the branding and styling of the website.

- Brand and font choices drafted
- Very basic styling chosen
- Mobile experience rudimentary

Accessibility work has not begun.

Content
=======

I plan to extend the book with complete code listings, tests,
screenshots, and "Go further" links.

- Chapter 1 and 2 code is edited, while the rest are drafted
- Chapter 1 has "Go further" links, the others don't
- Tests not begun
- Screenshots not begun
