Code
====

I plan to have "gold-standard" code for each chapter.

- [x] Code for chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 edited
- [ ] Code for chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 not yet edited
- [ ] [Chapter 8](forms.md) needs to abstract over finding elements
- [ ] [Chapter 9](scripts.md) needs to split the JS environment from
  the browser
- [ ] [Chapter 10](reflow.md) needs to be more uniform and clearer
- [ ] I plan a cleaned-up, "final" browser as an appendix

Website
=======

The website is up, but in a minimal form.

- [x] Domain name purchased and set up, and TLS enabled
- [x] The site scores well on page speed tests
- [x] Feedback system for typos and comments deployed
- [x] Server logs set up, but not deeper analytics
- [ ] No work on accessibility

I have barely begun branding and styling the website.

- [x] Brand and font choices drafted
- [ ] Styling is still very minimal
- [ ] Web page does not have a coherent visual identity
- [ ] Mobile experience rudimentary

Marketing
=========

- [x] There is now a signup form run by Mailchimp
- [x] There is now a [book Twitter](https://twitter.com/BrowserBook)
- [x] I posted about the book on my personal account
- [ ] The book has not yet done well on HN
- [ ] The book has not been posted to proggit

Content
=======

I plan tests, exercises, screenshots, and "Go further" links.

- [x] Each chapter has five exercises
- [ ] There are currently no tests
- [ ] Screenshots not begun
